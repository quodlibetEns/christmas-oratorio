        <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <h2>Get started</h2>
                <p>Welcome to this site dedicated to enjoying Bach's <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, or <i>Weihnachts-Oratorium</i>. The oratorio, one of Bach's many masterpieces, is a dramatic and spiritual exploration of the themes and stories of the Christmas season. Made up of arias, chorales, and recitative from scripture, the oratorio is divided into six parts for six of the major liturigcal days of the Christmas season as Bach knew it in Leipzig, where this music was first performed at the end of 1734.</p>
                <p>This site presents the German text of the whole oratorio with a facing English translation, so you can follow the text as you listen. There are also options to listen to the oratorio on the page.</p>
            <h2>How to listen along</h2>
                <p>There are two ways you can listen to the oratorio as you scroll through the text. The first is to use the <em>Spotify player</em> we've embedded on the page for each track, which will play a great recording by The Sixteen with the Orchestra of Harmony and Invention. This allows you to listen right in the page next to the lyrics, but you'll need to be logged in to a Spotify account (or make one). Alternatively, you can of course listen separately to <b>your own recording</b>, which you may prefer anyway if you have a favourite version. Plenty of great versions are available out there, including for free: if you're not sure what to listen to, you could try <a href="https://youtu.be/zpaNo4mWRBE">on Youtube</a>.</p>
